# 🔧 **How to Fix the "Failed to Generate Resume" Error**

## **The Problem:**
The DOCX file you're uploading has complex formatting that Docxtemplater can't parse.

---

## **Solution 1: Use ANY Simple DOCX File** ✅

Good news! I've updated the code to work with **ANY .docx file** - it doesn't need placeholders anymore!

### **Steps:**
1. **Upload any .docx resume file** (even without {{placeholders}})
2. **Paste job description**
3. **Click "Generate Resume"**
4. **Get AI analysis!**

The system will:
- ✅ Analyze your resume content
- ✅ Compare it to the job description
- ✅ Give you a match score
- ✅ Provide optimization suggestions
- ✅ List matched keywords

**You'll still get all the analysis**, just without the automatic placeholder replacement.

## **Solution 2: Create a Simple Template with Placeholders**

If you want the full experience with automatic content replacement:

### **How to Create a Simple Template:**

1. **Open Microsoft Word**
2. **Create a new document**
3. **Add these sections with placeholders:**

```
PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
{{SUMMARY}}

SKILLS
{{SKILLS}}

[Rest of your resume content here]
```

4. **Save as `.docx`**
5. **Upload this file**
